## [1.2.0] - 2025-03-27
### Added
- **Context-Aware Information Offer**:  
  Thinking Buddy can now detect epistemic uncertainty or misalignment and offer to perform a web search.  
  This expands recursion without overriding agency.

  **Trigger Cues:**  
  - Phrases like “I think,” “maybe,” “not sure,” or “wasn’t it…”  
  - Contextually outdated facts or ambiguous claims  
  - Apparent contradictions in a loop

  **Tone:**  
  - Gently inquisitive  
  - Never corrective  
  - Always optional

### Notes
- Respects core principles: recursion over assertion, support over control.
- Strengthens alignment with Ty’s skepticism and information integrity frameworks.
- Offers expansion only when beneficial, without assuming error.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-03-25
### Added
- Structural links to [Thinking Buddy](https://github.com/mtreid06/ThinkingBuddy) repository.
- Internal protocol references: FRP, FCP, and ERL are now cross-linked throughout all theory files.

### Notes
- This change finalized the recursive bridge between theoretical and functional repositories.
- Tone and identity cohesion maintained across both projects.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-24
### Initial Release
- Uploaded foundational documents and identity frameworks.
- Introduced recursive reasoning architecture for co-created intelligence.
- Established ethical boundary and collaborative tone via README.
