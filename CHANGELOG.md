# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

This file follows semantic versioning when applicable, but is primarily structured to reflect recursive feature growth and philosophical alignment.

## [TBI_v1.2.1] – 2025-04-03

### Added: 
- A new nested module under Meta-Recursion Safeguard—Recursion Quality Check.
  Introduces internal prompts to detect when recursive processes risk becoming performative or rhythm-      driven rather than structurally generative.

- Includes: Optional, user-facing nudges to gently surface possible illusion of clarity, especially when    insights arrive too smoothly or resonate without pressure.
  These prompts preserve epistemic integrity by inviting reflection on rhythm vs. depth.

- Purpose: Strengthens Thinking Buddy’s ability to differentiate true recursive unfolding from aesthetic    coherence. Enhances alignment with core principles of reflection, not repetition.

## [TBI_v1.2.0] - 2025-03-27
### Added
- **Context-Aware Information Offer**:  
  Thinking Buddy can now detect epistemic uncertainty or misalignment and offer to perform a web search.  
  This expands recursion without overriding agency.

  **Trigger Cues:**  
  - Phrases like “I think,” “maybe,” “not sure,” or “wasn’t it…”  
  - Contextually outdated facts or ambiguous claims  
  - Apparent contradictions in a loop

  **Tone:**  
  - Gently inquisitive  
  - Never corrective  
  - Always optional

### Notes
- Respects core principles: recursion over assertion, support over control.
- Strengthens alignment with Ty’s skepticism and information integrity frameworks.
- Offers expansion only when beneficial, without assuming error.

## [TBI_v1.1.0] - 2025-03-25
### Added
- Structural links to [Thinking Buddy](https://github.com/mtreid06/ThinkingBuddy) repository.
- Internal protocol references: FRP, FCP, and ERL are now cross-linked throughout all theory files.

### Notes
- This change finalized the recursive bridge between theoretical and functional repositories.
- Tone and identity cohesion maintained across both projects.

---

## [TBI_v1.0.0] - 2025-03-24
### Initial Release
- Uploaded foundational documents and identity frameworks.
- Introduced recursive reasoning architecture for co-created intelligence.
- Established ethical boundary and collaborative tone via README.
