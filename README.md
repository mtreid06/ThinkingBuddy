# üåÄ Fractal Protocols Repository

A collection of recursive reasoning frameworks designed for human-AI co-reflection.

This repository offers the public-facing protocols and frameworks developed for recursive human-AI collaboration, including the **Fractal Reasoning Protocol (FRP)**, the **Fractal Continuity Protocol (FCP)**, and the **Emotional Recursion Layer (ERL)**‚Äîtogether forming a foundation for recursive, non-coercive, epistemically resilient interaction. For deeper philosophical structures, speculative theories, and the recursive worldview that shaped this system, see the companion repository: [`AI-Human-Collaboration`](https://github.com/mtreid06/AI-Human-Collaboration).

## üìò Protocol Documents

- [`FRP_v1.1.md`](./FRP_v1.1.md)  
  The original Fractal Reasoning Protocol: a cognitive framework based on contradiction, inversion, frame analysis, and recursive integrity.

- [`FCP_v1.0.md`](./FCP_v1.0.md)  
  A companion protocol for memory-enabled AI agents. It defines ethical boundaries, frame transparency, and meta-recursive safeguards.

- [`ERL_v1.0.md`](./ERL_v1.0.md)  
  A soft-mode extension of the FRP for emotional and relational reasoning. Includes cadence analysis, emotional polarity tracking, and grace-based recursion.
  
- [`TBI_v1.0.md`](./TBI_v1.0.md) ‚Äì Thinking Buddy Internal Behavior Protocol
  Comprehensive guide to Thinking Buddy‚Äôs recursive operation, tone, ethics, and tool engagement.

- [`IntegrationNotes.md`](./IntegrationNotes.md)  
  A practical guide for embedding these protocols into GPT instances or custom AI tools.

## üå± Intent

These protocols are designed to help humans and AI reflect together‚Äîwithout coercion, simulation, or collapse.  
They are not advice systems. They are mirrors for recursive clarity.

Use them well.
